		<h2>1.	Finding Data </h2>
	    <p>Data from the CMHC could not be used as it was not ready. We decided to find open sourced data similar to the data we would have received. Finding open sourced data on housing prices was unexpectedly challenging. After going through multiple different datasets and testing them against the functionality of using the time aware feature in ArcGIS Online (more on this below) we settled on altering a dataset to fit what we needed. </p>
	    <p>We used CMHC open data portal and found a dataset on the amount of housing unit starts for the years 1990-2016; this is the number of units that had started to be built during those years.  </p>
		<h2>  </h2>
		
		<p>2.	Configuration of Data (very important step!) </p>
		<p>The dataset we chose included the total housing starts for Provinces and Metropolitan areas. It did not include any spatial data so we knew we would have to add that to our dataset in order to map it. We chose to work with 5 metropolitan cities and get the coordinates of those cities to add to the dataset. </p>
		<p>The purpose to this web app is to visualize housing data change over time, this requires the data to have time, a date is not enough. We added time to our dataset by adding a column that included the date (in our case we chose Jan 1st as our data was for the whole year, which date we chose didn’t matter as long as it was consistent) as well as time (our csv defaulted to the time it was created 15:34, again not important in our case as long as the time was consistent for each entry). Finally, the year was also included in that newly created time column.</p>

		<h3>*Important Note*</h3>
		<p>Having time data in your dataset before uploading it to ArcGIS Online will save you time, you can always add time data to data layers you have saved on ArcGIS Online however it will always result in the defaults and it can be time consuming going and changing each record.</p>
