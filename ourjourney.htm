		h2>1.	Finding Data </h2>
	    <p>Data from the CMHC could not be used as it was not ready. We decided to find open sourced data similar to the data we would have received. Finding open sourced data on housing prices was unexpectedly challenging. After going through multiple different datasets and testing them against the functionality of using the time aware feature in ArcGIS Online (more on this below) we settled on altering a dataset to fit what we needed. </p>
	    <p>We used CMHC open data portal and found a dataset on the amount of housing unit starts for the years 1990-2016; this is the number of units that had started to be built during those years.  </p>
