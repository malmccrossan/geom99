		        <h3>PHASE 1: UPDATING PROBLEM STATEMENT AND REQUIREMENT DOCUMENTS</h3> 
		        <p class="problem"><em>Project:</em> Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) Web Application  </p>
                <p class="problem"><em>Ideal:</em>An interactive web app that will show housing prices and infilling over time in a chosen area.</p>
                <p class="problem"><em>Problem Statement:</em> CMHC mostly uses paper maps and is looking to transfer to online maps in order to display more data that can still be easily understood. Paper maps are limited to its size, limiting small-scale maps in what information they can display. For example, displaying 
                     census tracts for Ontario along with housing pricing on a paper map would be too cluttered. </p>

Paper maps are limited to its size, limiting small-scale maps in what information they can display. For example, displaying census tracts for Ontario along with housing pricing on a paper map would be too cluttered.
                <p class="problem"><em>Consequences:</em> The aim of this app will help CHMC displaying and sharing their data without difficulty of using paper map. This will hinder their abilities to use the data as a source in advocating for policy reform and presenting their research. </p>
                
                <p class="problem"><em>Proposal: </em>We would like to use ArcGIS Experience builder to create a web app that will be able to show how housing prices and infilling have changed over a period of time. </p>   
                <p class="problem"><em>Dataset: </em> For this web app, we searched for open source data in .csv format and stored in the Time field including date and time. Data file is includes lat/long as the center of the metropolitan. Initially, the looked for USA municipality real state avaliable datesets. A veriety of data set from North Carolina and Connectivet were found. The group was working on data to how to gecode in QGIS. 
			Meanwile, a dataset of Ontario provided by <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/data-and-research/data-tables/total-housing-starts-canada-provinces-metropolitan-areas" target="_blank">CMHC</a>  was introduced by Malena Mccrossan. A small size of data of housing prices during 2012 to 2016 were generated to apply for this project. </p>   
                
                <h3>PHASE 2: EXPLORING NETWORK ANALYSIS IN ARCGIS ONLINE AND ALTERNATIVE APPLICATION</h3>
		<p class="problem"> <em>ArcGIS Online</em> a cloud-based mapping platform was examined in order to host the data layer. To enable the time, an ESRI product Time Aware 
			 a Time-enabled confgurable app was generated to create the primary web app. To enable the time feature, the csv data file was hosted as a layer and then referenced that layer into your map to enable the time feature. </p>
