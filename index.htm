	            <h2>Problem Challenges</h2>
		        <h3>PHASE 1: UPDATING PROBLEM STATEMENT AND REQUIREMENT DOCUMENTS</h3> 
		        <p class="problem"><em>Project:</em> Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) Web Application  </p>
                <p class="problem"><em>Ideal: </em>An interactive web app that will show housing prices and infilling over time in a chosen area.</p>
                <p class="problem"><em>Problem Statement:</em> CMHC mostly uses paper maps and is looking to transfer to online maps in order to display more data that can still be easily understood. Paper maps are limited to its size, limiting small-scale maps in what information they can display. For example, displaying census tracts for Ontario along with housing pricing on a paper map would be too cluttered. </p>
                
                <p class="problem"><em>Consequences:</em> The aim of this app will help CHMC in displaying and sharing their data without the limitations of a paper map. Without this, it will hinder their ability to use the data as a source in advocating for policy reform and presenting their research. </p>
                
                <p class="problem"><em>Proposal: </em>We will use ArcGIS Experience builder to create a web app that will be able to show how housing prices and infilling have changed over a period of time. </p>  
		
                <p class="problem"><em>Dataset: </em> For this web app, we searched for open source data in .csv format that also included a <i>Time</i> field, as well as a date. The data file includes lat/long as the center of the metropolitan. Initially, we looked for USA municipality real state datesets. A variety of datasets from North Carolina and Connecticut were found. The group was working on how to geocode the data in QGIS in order to display each specfic housing data, but were running into complications. The data process was taking too long, and we were making it too complicated for ourselves.
			
			Meanwile, a dataset of Ontario provided by <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/data-and-research/data-tables/total-housing-starts-canada-provinces-metropolitan-areas" target="_blank">CMHC</a>  was introduced by Malena. The dataset was modified to show a small portion of it by displaying the number of housing units from 2012 to 2016. </p>   
                
                <h3>PHASE 2: EXPLORING NETWORK ANALYSIS IN ARCGIS ONLINE AND ALTERNATIVE APPLICATION</h3>
		<p class="problem"><a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-online/overview" target="_blank"><em>ArcGIS Online</em></a>  a cloud-based mapping platform was examined in order to host the data layer. To enable the time, an ESRI product 
			<a href="https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/mapping/mapping/using-the-time-aware-configurable-app-template/" target="_blank"><em>Time Aware</em></a>, 
			 a Time-enabled confgurable app was utlized to create the primary web app. To enable the time feature, the csv data file was hosted as a layer and then referenced that layer into the map to enable the time feature. </p>
